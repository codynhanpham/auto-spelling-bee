Or check out the [MP4 version](./demo/SpellingBeeDemo.mp4) of the demo instead.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the letters in the Spelling Bee game as prompted.
3. Check the output for the words that can be formed from the letters. The results are ranked by possible points.
4. If you want the program to automatically type out the words, follow the prompts.

## Notes
The program uses the [words_alpha.txt](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt) English word list from [dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words). The list contains words that may not be in the Spelling Bee game's word list.
